# Godot-Empty-Template
A Godot project directory folders for simple, clean tidy project
I use it for many projects
You can use it by:
1. Make a new Godot project.
1. Download the project from github.
1. Copy files & folders from the project into the Godot Project directory.

Additional tip [In '.gitignore' file]:
* If you want to the files in the directory '/.import/' to be ignored on github pushs, uncomment that line
* If you want to the files with the extension '.import' to be ignored on github pushs, uncomment that line

The directories are divided into :
* Assets
* Objects
* Scenes
* Scripts
* Test Zones
* Themes

### Assets:
Any assets & have already some prototype images for some shapes in the mock-up folder

### Objects:
Any object that is multiple used: player, door, weapon, etc...

### Scenes:
Any scene that is used in the game: menus, levels, end screen, etc...

### Scripts:
Any script are stored here: player_movement.gd, guns.gd, etc...

### Test Zones:

### Themes:
Which have a directory for fonts that is divided into [bitmap, dynamic, raw]
