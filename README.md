# Godot-Empty-Template
A Godot project directory folders for simple, clean tidy project
I use it for many projects
You can use it by:
1. Make a new Godot project.
1. Download the project from github.
1. Copy files & folders from the project into the Godot Project directory.

Additional tip [In '.gitignore' file]:
* If you want to the files in the directory '/.import/' to be ignored on github pushs, uncomment that line
* If you want to the files with the extension '.import' to be ignored on github pushs, uncomment that line

The directories are divided into :
* Assets
* Objects
* Scenes
* Scripts
* Test Zones
* Themes
* Shaders
